## Exercise

Legacy code has been migrated into Spring Boot application with 
SQL database, RESTful web services and AngularJS frontend.

### Task

Application is to be deployed into production, but in final code review step
serious doubts were raised about the quality of the application. The reviewers
recommendation was a full application rewrite. Your task is to identify and fix
all flaws in the code-package, ensuring that the resulting application is ready
to be put into production. You may ignore the frontend entirely, and break the
entirety of the API, if it results in cleaner code.

Rewrite and improve all parts of the code package.

Zip and upload your solution to the folder you downloaded it from on google
drive.

### Scope

Please focus on the backend. Identify as many issues as you can, fix the most
important ones and list the rest in your submission for discussion during
interview.

### Running the application

Linux:
`./mvnw spring-boot:run` and go to a browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

Windows:
`./mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run` and go to a browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
